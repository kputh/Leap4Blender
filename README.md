# Leap4Blender

Leap4Blender is a plugin for [blender](https://www.blender.org/). It enables you to perform basic actions - select, scale, translate, rotate and undo - using gesture control. And it requires a [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) controller to work.

**Warning**: This plugin is a prototype, and has lastly been changed in September 2013. The Leap Motion API and blender API used are likely outdated.
